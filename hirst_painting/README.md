# Hirst Painting Project

## Description

The Hirst Painting project uses the Turtle graphics library to create a painting inspired by the artist Damien Hirst. The program extracts colors from an image and uses those colors to draw a grid of colored dots on the screen.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have an image named `hirst_painting.jpg` in the project directory.
2. Run the `main.py` script to generate the painting.
3. The Turtle graphics window will open and display the dots.

## Files

- `main.py`: The main script that runs the painting program.
- `hirst_painting.jpg`: The image from which colors are extracted.

## Running the Project

To run the project, navigate to the `hirst-painting` directory and execute the `main.py` script using Python:

```bash
cd hirst-painting
python main.py
```
