## About

This repository is designed to help track progress and showcase various Python projects. The projects range from simple practice assignments to more complex applications. The goal is to maintain a comprehensive collection of Python work that can be used for learning, reference, and demonstration purposes.

## Projects

### Higher Lower Game

- **Description:** A simple game where the player guesses which of two entities has more followers.

### More Projects

- As more projects are added, they will be listed here in the same format.

## Adding New Projects

When adding a new project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Directory:** Create a new directory under the root folder for the project.
2. **Add Project Files:** Add all necessary files (e.g., `main.py`, `README.md`).
3. **Update the README:** Add a new section under [Projects](#projects) for the new project, following the format used for previous projects.

## How to Use

To run any of the projects, navigate to the project's directory and execute the main script using Python. For example:

```bash
cd higher-lower-game
python main.py

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. For some projects, additional dependencies might be required. Refer to the README.md file within each project directory for specific instructions.o
