# Turtle Race

## Description

The Turtle Race project is a simple turtle race game using the Turtle graphics library in Python. The user bets on which turtle will win the race, and the turtles move randomly across the screen to determine the winner.

## How to Use

1. Run the `main.py` script.
2. Enter your bet for which turtle will win the race (choose a color from red, blue, green, yellow, orange, purple).
3. Watch the race and see if your chosen turtle wins!

## Files

- `main.py`: The main script that runs the turtle race.

## Running the Project

To run the project, navigate to the `turtle-race` directory and execute the `main.py` script using Python:

```bash
cd turtle-race
python main.py
```
